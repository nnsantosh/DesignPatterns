# DesignPatterns
All design patterns will be implemented using java

## Single Responsiblity Principle(SRP):
The single-responsibility principle (SRP) is a computer-programming principle that states that every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class, module or function.
Basically this is related to separation of concerns. A class in java should have only one concern and should not try to mix concerns.
It should just have single responsiblity.
